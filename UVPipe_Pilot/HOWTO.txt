Running UVPipe Python Scripts
-----------------------------

# Before running the UVPipe Python scripts, ensure that the UVPipe C++ scripts have already been executed on the Level1 dataset. Instructions for running the UVPipe C++ scripts can be found in the UVPipe_Driver directory.

# Install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

#1. Ensure the astrometry.net package is installed. Download the Astrometry.net index files from https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12684907. Edit the astrometry.cfg file located in the UVPipe_Pilot directory to configure Astrometry.net to use the downloaded index files.

#2. Copy all files from the UVPipe_Pilot directory to the working directory containing the Level1 dataset. Ensure that the products generated by the C++ scripts are present in this directory. Then, run the UVIT_pilot.sh script.
