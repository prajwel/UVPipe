How to run the UVPipe C++ scripts
---------------------------------

# Keep the Level1 dataset in a working area.
# For example, assume that the working area is /home/prajwel/where_Level1_data_is_kept/.
# Follow the below steps to build and run the container image using Podman.

#1. Navigate to the UVPipe_Driver directory and specify a temporary directory (TMPDIR). For example:
export TMPDIR=/home/prajwel/podman_tmp

#2. Build the container image using the following command:
podman build -t uvpipe_driver .

#3. Keep the appropriate UVIT_DriverModule.par file alongside the Level1 dataset at /home/prajwel/where_Level1_data_is_kept/.
# Commonly used variations of the UVIT_DriverModule.par file can be found at UVPipe_Driver/Driver_module_param_files.

#4. Run the uvpipe_driver container with the following command:
podman run --rm -it -v /home/prajwel/where_Level1_data_is_kept:/app/work_area:Z uvpipe_driver

# Note 1: To reset the Podman environment and clean up all builds, use the following command:
podman system reset

# Note 2: Unless you make any changes to the contents of the UVPipe_Driver directory, steps 1 and 2 needs to be executed only once. The image, once built, will be available until it is removed.
